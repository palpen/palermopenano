**Occupation Choice of Castes, Tribes, and Women and India's Urban Economic Growth**

>Between 1983 and 2005 India's real GDP per capita grew by 125%. Using wage, occupation, social group, and gender data from five rounds of the National Sample Survey, this paper tests the occupational choice model in Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, and Klenow (2013) for India. The model allows the estimation of occupational barriers facing high caste women, low caste men, and low caste women for both rural and urban households. Estimates of the model suggests that disadvantaged groups continue to face high barriers in their occupational choice relative to high caste males. Over time, the magnitude of the barriers for low caste men and women have remained stable. Occupational barriers causes a misallocation of talent: high caste males make up a large share of people in highly skilled occupations. Low caste men and women, on the other hand, make up most of the people in low skill occupations. A reallocation of talent should improve aggregate output through more equal marginal product of labour across occupations. Although India experienced tremendous growth between 1983 and 1985, the estimates of the general equilibrium model suggests that such reallocation of talent in India can explain only between 0% and 2% of average urban output growth.

**Trade and Ethnic Inequality: Evidence from India**

>Does greater competition due to free trade make economic inequality less about ethnicity? I use the decrease in import tariffs in India in 1991 to calculate changes in between- and within-caste/tribe (ethnic) inequality. Greater competition arising from imports from other countries should make it more difficult for firms to discriminate against people from certain castes or tribes. Thus, regions that were affected most by the tariff reductions should have less ethnic inequality, as measured by the Theil Index. I find that between 1987 and 1999, inequality have decreased across the between- and within-caste/tribe component of the Theil index. A regression of the Theil index calculated using predicted wages on tariff protection suggests that differences in human capital explains reduction in caste inequality. To understand the mechanism underlying these results, I estimate a regression model to check how the tariff cuts affected wages directly. These estimates suggests that people from disadvantaged ethnic groups had higher increases in wages in regions where the decrease in tariff protection were greatest.
