I'm Palermo. I work as an applied scientist in the tech industry. My academic training is in economics, but I have special interest and professional experience in causal inference, experiment design, machine learning (with tabular data), and online ad auctions. I have also worked as a manager and as a tech lead building and coordinating projects in the data science domain.
