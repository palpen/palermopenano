Hello. I am a PhD candidate in [economics](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca).

My broad research interests include development economics, empirical microeconomics, and international trade. I am also interested in the applications of [geographic information systems][1] to issues in environmental economics and firm productivity. At present, I am working on documenting the spatial distribution of firm productivity in India and China and the role that transportation infrastructure play in changing this distribution.
