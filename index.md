Welcome! I'm an economics graduate with deep interest in data analytics, programming, and machine learning. Previously, I was a graduate student in applied economics at the University of Toronto where I did empirical research on economic development. Knowledgeable in a wide range of tools (>4 years using Python) and datasets
including geospatial data and large company- and individual-level panel data. In my free time, I like working on programming and machine learning related projects ([like this one](http://pspenano.pythonanywhere.com/)).

Please see the __About__ page for more details about my professional profile (including my resume) and the link to my GitHub page.
